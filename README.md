# smart-POS
This is a desktop-based sales management application built using Visual Basic .NET in Visual Studio 2022. The app connects to a local MySQL database via an ODBC connection. It is designed to handle basic sales transactions and product management with a clean and simple interface.

## Features

### 1. Sales Transactions
- Accessible via Form1
- Auto-generated sales invoice number (read-only)
- Allows users to:
  - Select a transaction date using a `DateTimePicker`
  - Choose a customer from a dropdown (automatically fills in related details)
  - Add products to a transaction via dropdown (auto-fills code, category, price, etc.)
  - Enter quantity to calculate subtotal automatically
- Sales data is added to the transaction log after pressing the **Add** button
- Total sales amount is only saved to the database when the **Save** button is clicked
- Added items are displayed in a `DataGridView` with a live total calculator

### 2. Product Management
- Accessible via Form2
- Two main sections:
  - Add Product Categories & Units
    - Input category or unit using text fields and save them with action buttons
  - Add New Products
    - Auto-generated product codes (read-only)
    - Input fields for product name, category, unit, purchase price, selling price, and initial stock
    - Data saved to the product table upon clicking Save Product

### Input Validation
- Input fields use `ErrorProvider` for error handling and validation
- Users are prevented from submitting empty or invalid data
